/*
    In JavaScript, a "default export" is a way to share a single value, function, or class as the main thing from a file with other parts of your code.

    When you have a file that needs to be used in other parts of your application, you can mark one item in that file as the "default export" using the export default syntax.

    This means that when you import from that file in another part of your code, you don't need to use curly braces {} around the import statement. Instead, you can give it any name you want during the import, making it more convenient to use.


    // ðŸ“‚ math.js
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;

    export default add;

    // ðŸ“‚ main.js
    import myAddFunction from './math.js';
    
    const result = myAddFunction(5, 10); // This will call the add function from math.js and store the result in the 'result' variable.
